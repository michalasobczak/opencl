# OpenCL

In order to run samples, try as it as follows:

```
$HOME/.jdks/openjdk-15.0.2/bin/java 
-classpath $HOME/IdeaProjects/opencl/demo_no_1/out/production/reusing_code
          :$HOME/jocl-2.0.2.jar
          :$HOME/IdeaProjects/opencl/demo_no_1/out/production/demo_no_1 com.company2.Main
```

It will work properly assuming you fetched code into $HOME/IdeaProjects and you downloaded JOCL library into $HOME as well.
